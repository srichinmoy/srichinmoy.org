We shall always remember, follow and treasure the value in his words:</p>

The inner message of the United Nations is love.<br />
The inmost message of the United Nations is oneness.”</p>

It is even more confusing when somebody who has exhibited such unbelievable dynamism, such strength, such humility, such power...somehow seems gone from our lives. But that is not the truth. It may be the reality, but it is not the truth. Because what is a visionary, but for his vision? The visionary may be gone, but the vision is here.”</p>

<p>"Though Sri Chinmoy has left this earth physically, he is in peace with God, and is spiritually present among us through his prayer, his message of peace and the example of the life he has lived in the service of humanity promoting peace…We commend Sri Chinmoy and all of you to the prayer of our Mother – Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, who knew Sri Chinmoy very well and appreciated his works of peace, for she knew ‘Works of love are works of peace.'"</p>

<p>“Sri Chinmoy embodied the spirit of peace which the world so badly needs. He did this through his poetry, his paintings, his teaching, but above all through his life and spiritual presence. Through the World Harmony Run he helped people make friends across the differences of religion, race, language, colour and culture. He enabled many of us to see these differences not as barriers but as enriching for us all. His dedicated service to the Oneness of humanity should be lifted up and remembered as an example to us all."</p>

<p>“Sri Chinmoy was a unique inspiration, living proof of the Divine possibilities within mankind. He was one of the few who spoke of God-Realisation from his own experience in much the same profound manner as our Gurudeva. How he exuded love. How he showed the way of goodness and gentleness. How he lived so we might all live more perfectly, serve more selflessly. Our several encounters with him both in Kauai and New York were precious moments of joy.”</p>

<p>“Sri Chinmoy always inspired me. He used to call me his outer coach in running but say he was my inner coach. I may have lost my student, but, though he has passed on physically, I know I have not lost my coach spiritually...His life was all about challenging yourself and being the best you can be. He told his disciples to go out and meet a challenge you don’t think you can do. He’s the reason I plan on running the New York marathon when I’m 50.<em>"</em></p>

<p>“We are grateful to the Supreme that in the course of life we met this man. Sri Chinmoy taught us to take correct decisions by listening to our hearts; he made us more spiritual. He is and will always be for us an inspirer, a wise Teacher, a worthy example. The intellectual and spiritual heritance that Sri Chinmoy has left us gives us an opportunity to continue perfecting ourselves endlessly.”</p>

<p>"We are addressing everyone who knew, learned about and will learn about this Great man of Kindness, Sri Chinmoy. On Earth one more of her sons is no more, the one who embodied Kindness and Peace for humanity. We immensely grieve over this great loss, and the grief that our hearts experience cannot be expressed in words. As wise men have said, nothing and nobody is eternal under the Moon, but how would we wish that people like respected Sri Chinmoy would live and give us joy as long as possible...<em>"</em></p>

<p>“The passing of Sri Chinmoy represents the loss of one of the last of the great spiritual teachers who brought the tradition of Indian spirituality to the West. He had a very special connection to music. In his performances, with clarity, simplicity and directness, he was able to move his listeners in a very immediate and deeply emotional way. In his lifetime he brought tremendous joy to the people who were with him. For me, his life was a special and personal inspiration."</p>

<p>“I don't have words to express my sadness. Sri’s spirit will always be with us all. I just thank the higher power to have briefly had him and you in my life. Men like Sri Chinmoy were all too rare in this world. In fact, Sri Chinmoy was truly one-of-a-kind. I was, am and will always be his biggest fan, for he understood what truly matters most in life: and that is love. His love could fill an ocean. I join the many people touched by this man and pray that his message will touch many more. Sri, we love you, and we miss you.”</p>

<p>“Finding one’s way in life is difficult even in the best of times. The presence of inspiring human beings is the surest way of receiving help and guidance in these matters. Five years of my life were spent under the direct tutelege of Sri Chinmoy. There are but a few real and true human beings to whom I will never ever be able to repay my debt of gratitude. The principle reason for this is that they have transcended the merely human and attained the All. Sri Chinmoy is one of these human beings. My gratitude to him will remain forever endless."</p>
