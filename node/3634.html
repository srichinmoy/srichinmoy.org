<p>God is constantly taking birth at every moment inside you—in what you say, in what you do and in what you become. God is constantly coming into you in a new form. With each new thought, each new idea, you can feel that a new God has dawned, a new God has taken birth. And what is He doing? He is taking you from lesser knowledge to greater knowledge. At your birth, God was born inside you. God is now at every moment taking birth inside you, making you better, nicer, wiser and more fulfilling. Your best qualities are qualities from God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Behind my hidden tears<br />
God is preparing Himself<br />
For a new dawn</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everybody has God inside, but not everybody is able to see God within. One can see God only when one cries for Him. Those who cry for God and pray to God can realise God. Everybody has hunger, but the one who has the money to buy food can eat. Similarly, everybody has God inside, but only he who has an inner cry can see God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>If your whole heart<br />
Cries for God,<br />
Then God’s whole Heart<br />
Will come to you.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>Why is it that I feel more divinity in a flower than in a piece of wood? Isn’t divinity in everything?</em>
</p>
<p>Divinity is in everything. God is manifesting in and through me, in and through you, in and through everyone and everything. But in some things or in some individuals we see that this divinity is more fully manifested. What you call darkness has inside it infinitesimal light. In this room you are seeing light, but this light can be immediately increased. There is no end to light. There is effulgent light, boundless light, infinite Light.</p>
<p>In the flower-consciousness God wanted to establish a certain amount of beauty. God did not feel it necessary to make this wall or a piece of wood as beautiful as a flower. But that does not mean that God is unkind to the wood or to the wall. In a play there may be a king and a slave. Also, there may be ordinary subjects. All these different roles are necessary. You cannot have a play with nothing but kings. No, you will need kings, ministers, subjects and so forth in order to have a good play.</p>
<p>In God’s creation, also, many different things are necessary. If God wants you to appreciate His Beauty aspect, then He will put a flower, or the stars, or a most beautiful child in front of you. If He wants you to appreciate His Power aspect, then immediately God will bring an elephant or a lion in front of you. If He wants you to appreciate His Vastness, then immediately He will bring the vast sky or sea in front of you. Again, if God wants you to appreciate His infinitesimal, tiniest part, then He will make you think of the atom. So it is up to God what aspect of His He wants you to appreciate. God has all aspects; He has all attributes. But He may decide that He wants you to appreciate one particular aspect of His more than other aspects.</p>
<p>Today God may want you to appreciate His Beauty aspect, tomorrow He may want you to appreciate His Peace aspect, and the day after tomorrow He may want you to appreciate His Power aspect. Whatever aspect you are meant to appreciate, God will put that particular aspect inside your consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>God’s Presence<br />
In my mind-cave,<br />
In my heart-room,<br />
In my life-street<br />
I see, I clearly see!<br />
Therefore, I feel that<br />
My God-realisation-days<br />
Are fast approaching.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>I have found in my search for God that He is all around me and within me. The unity with Him is becoming very understandable. What is puzzling me is the separation. What is the sense of separation?</em>
</p>
<p>If you see and feel God around you and within you, then how can you have a sense of separation? Inside me is the heart; inside me is the soul. If something is outside my body, then I can have a feeling of separation. But I cannot separate my heart from my body or from myself because my body and my heart are part and parcel of each other and of my life. If I separate one from the other, then I do not exist at all. If you really feel God within you, then there can be no sense of separation.</p>
<p>What actually happens is that at this moment you are living in your heart and you feel God’s Presence within you, but the next moment you are living in the physical mind. At that time you doubt your own existence and you doubt the reality that you have just experienced. When you start doubting, the sense of separativity comes into existence. At that time you feel that you are losing something, that you are separated from something. But you do not lose anything. Once you have got something, it is there within you. But if you do not know how to utilise it all the time at your sweet will, then you feel that you have lost it.</p>
<p>When you pray early in the morning, at that time you feel God’s Presence within you and around you. Then, when you enter into the hustle and bustle of life, perhaps you forget God’s existence. The moment you forget, you feel a sense of separation. But that sense of separation is not actually caused by the absence of God within you. His Presence is there, but ignorance enters into you and veils your consciousness, which a few hours ago early in the morning helped you identify with God and feel your inseparable oneness with Him.</p>
<p>That is why inwardly we try to remain in constant prayer or meditation. Outwardly it is impossible. We have to stay on earth. We have to go to the office; we have to go to school; we have to enter into multifarious activities. But inside our mind, inside our heart, we can do whatever we want. Outwardly we may talk to our friends and do everything that is necessary in our day-to-day life, but inside we can keep the living Presence of God. Since we have the soul within us, we feel we are divine; since we have the aspiring heart within us, we feel we are divine. So also, when we go outside and mix with our friends, we have to remember—not out of pride or vanity, but out of sheer necessity—that we are of the Divine and we are for the Divine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>God’s Compassion exists<br />
In every life-experience of yours,<br />
Whether you believe it or not.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to feel not only the divinity in ourselves, but also the divinity in others. For in this way we can feel our oneness with the Supreme in mankind. One way to feel our oneness with others is to feel that we are everything. But then we may come to think that we are superior to everyone, and that will only defeat our purpose. If we feel that only we are divine, that only we possess divinity whereas others possess undivine forces, then immediately there will be a clash. But if we feel that we are of the Source, then we shall try also to see the Divine in others. If we feel that we are divine, and while talking and mixing with others, if we can see the Divine in them, then our divinity and their divinity will not quarrel or clash. When we feel that we are divine, it is absolutely true. But at the same time we have to feel that others are also equally divine.</p>
<p>Our difficulty is that most of the time we do not have that kind of feeling. While we are praying at home, we see and feel that God is ours. But the moment we come out of our house and look around at others, we do not try to see God inside them. What we try to see in them is imperfection, something unlike ourselves. After our meditation, we come out of the heart and enter into the mind, or we enter into the vital. Then we try to separate ourselves from others and we see others as undivine. But when we come out into the world, if we can bring with us the divinity we saw and felt during our meditation at home, and if we try to see the same divinity in others, then there is no feeling of separation. And if we see the same thing in others which we feel inside ourselves, then we shall never miss God’s Presence. We shall never lose our feeling of oneness with God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Each time I soulfully pray<br />
And self-givingly meditate,<br />
I see my Lord Supreme blossoming<br />
Beautifully and radiantly<br />
Inside my heart.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>What is the cause of this separation between man and God?</em>
</p>
<p>The cause of this separation is ignorance. We feel that ‘I’ and ‘my’ will give us real joy. It is like a child. If he is very energetic, dynamic or aggressive, he feels satisfaction only when he strikes someone or breaks something. That is his satisfaction; that is his peace. But a grown-up gets joy only by remaining calm, quiet and tranquil. Unfortunately, individuals feel that by maintaining their individuality and personality they can be happy. But that is wrong. Only by entering into universality can we be happy. Individuality and personality will derive satisfaction only from universality. A tiny drop, when it enters into the ocean and loses its individuality and personality, becomes what the infinite ocean is. But before that, if it fights for its own individual existence, what can it do as just a tiny drop? So it is the ignorance in the drop that makes the drop feel that it can be satisfied by maintaining a sense of separativity, which is absurd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>My Lord, is there any time<br />
When You do not love me?<br />
“Yes, My child, there is a time.”<br />
When, my Lord, when?<br />
“When you think that you are not<br />
A budding God.”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>What about the fact that we all live in individual homes and do different tasks and things like that? Isn’t that separation right there?</em>
</p>
<p>Yes, but this is not individuality; it is only the necessity that comes from having respective tasks. With my hand I write, with my mouth I eat, with my eyes I see. Even though they do different things, these are all parts of my body. Each individual also will do what he is supposed to do, but not with a sense of ego. He will do it with a sense of oneness. God has given me the capacity to do a particular thing. He has given you the capacity to do something else. Let us combine our capacities. I will not say that my capacity is superior to yours, and you will not say that your capacity is the only capacity worth having. The difficulty with the world is that everyone feels that he is infinitely more important than everyone else. The problem starts when you stay with your capacities, I stay with mine, and we do not unite our capacities.</p>
