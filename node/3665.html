<p>God was One, but He wanted to become many. You cannot enjoy a game with only one person. If you want to play any game, you will need more players. God originated Himself out of His own Silence in order to divinely enjoy the Cosmic Game.</p>
<p>If we go deep within, we see that we are only taking a conscious part in God’s Cosmic Game. We see that we are not the doers; God is the Doer. We are only His instruments. God is One, but He felt that He wanted to enjoy Himself, to fulfil Himself in millions of shapes and forms. He felt that being One, He was not fully satisfied. Why should He be satisfied with only being the One Infinite? He can also be the multitudinous finite. God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent. If He is omnipotent, then why should He not become like an ant, an infinitely tiny creature? Because of His omnipotent Power, we think of God as something very great or very vast. But just because God is omniscient and omnipotent, He can also be inside the finite. In this way, God is playing His eternal Game in and through you, through me, through all human beings.<br />
God is infinite, but He houses Himself in each tiny child. Here in the finite, He wants to enjoy Himself and play the tune of the Infinite. Only then does He get the greatest joy. It is in the finite that we are aspiring to achieve the Infinite. Again, the Infinite gets the greatest joy by making itself as tiny as possible.</p>
<p>Finite and infinite: to our outer eyes they seem to be opposites, but in God’s Eye they are one. The finite and the Infinite always go together; the one complements the other. The finite wants to reach the absolute Highest, which is the Infinite. The Infinite wants to manifest itself in and through the finite. Then the game is complete. Otherwise it will be only a one-sided game. There will be no joy, no achievement, no fulfilment. In and through the Infinite, the finite is singing its song of realisation. And in and through the finite, the Infinite is singing its song of manifestation.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Lord, I seek and You hide.<br />
I seek because without You<br />
My life-flames do not and cannot burn.<br />
Now Lord, tell me,<br />
Why do You hide?<br />
“Daughter, I hide because<br />
My hiding intensifies your seeking.<br />
It gratifies your loving,<br />
Glorifies your achievement<br />
And immortalises your enlightenment.”</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>What is the purpose of life?</em>
</p>
<p>The purpose of life is to manifest the inner divinity. The purpose of life is to become a conscious instrument, a chosen instrument of God. The purpose of life is to manifest the highest Truth which we embody. First we have to see the Truth and feel the Truth. Then we have to reveal and manifest the Truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>The purpose of life<br />
Is to become one with the Absolute Truth.<br />
This Absolute Truth<br />
Is God the infinite Compassion<br />
And<br />
God the infinite Satisfaction.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>The aim of life is to become conscious of the Supreme Reality. The aim of life is to be the conscious expression of the Eternal Being.</p>
<p>Life is evolution. Evolution is the unfoldment from within. Each life is a world in itself. Indeed, each life is a microcosm. Whatever breathes in the vast universe also breathes in each individual life.</p>
<p>The aim of life is to realise God. Realisation can never come to the individual who is inactive. We have to pay the price for it. There is no alternative.</p>
<p>We must love God first if we really love life, for God is not only the Source, but the very Breath of life. Love of God costs nothing, but it is worth much. Our mind knows this truth. Our soul embodies this truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>I have been loving God unconsciously<br />
For millennia,<br />
But I shall love God consciously<br />
From this moment on.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Each person has a soul, and each soul has a<br />
nature of its own. The soul, which is the direct representative of God, comes down to earth in order to fulfil the promise that it has made to the Absolute in the highest plane of consciousness, Heaven. Each soul has to manifest its inner divinity here on earth in a specific way. It is through the revelation of its own light that the soul manifests its inner divinity. When the soul, through its own aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation, enters into the Cosmic Self, then it completes its journey on earth.</p>
<p>To see the light of your soul, you have to feel that you are not the body, you are not the vital, you are not the mind, you are not the heart, but you are the soul itself. In order to have this experience, you have to feel that you need God and God needs you. You need God to raise your consciousness as high as possible—high, higher, highest. God needs you to manifest Himself in and through you here on earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>My life is a little boat;<br />
It is a feeble cry.<br />
But my soul is a representative<br />
Of the omnipotent,<br />
Omnipresent and omniscient God.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>Can we understand God through just the finite part of His creation?</em>
</p>
<p>Let us take God as the vast ocean. You know that the ocean is composed of tiny drops. Millions and billions and trillions of drops make up the ocean. If we know how to identify ourselves both with the vast ocean and with the tiniest drop, then we can see God inside the finite and also in the Infinite. It is on the strength of our oneness with the tiniest drop in the ocean that we can see and feel God. If we can establish our oneness with the finite, then we can see what the Infinite looks like.</p>
<p>If we want to see God in His vast creation, as the creation itself, we can do it. But in the beginning it may be easier to separate Him from His creation and identify ourselves with only a small portion of the entire creation. Even in the small part of God’s creation which is right now visible to us, we see infinite variety. What will we do with God’s entire creation at this time? Our mind will not be able to grasp it at all. To our limited human mind even the finite earth-reality is infinite. If we can begin to understand this tiny corner of God’s vast creation, we can say that we have made considerable inner progress.</p>
<p>
<em>It is hard for me to get out of my finite self and feel one with the Infinite.</em>
</p>
<p>The finite in us is not aware of the Infinite, but when it is made aware of the Infinite, it has an inferiority complex, and it does not want to be consciously one with the Infinite. Inside the finite is an ignorance-force. But the Infinite feels its oneness with the finite. It feels that there was a time when it was not the entire ocean; it was just a tiny drop, like the finite. Then, from that tiny drop, it widened its consciousness and expanded into the ocean itself. This occurred through the process of evolution.</p>
<p>Again, the Highest, the Absolute Truth, was originally One. God was One, and then He decided to become many. The Infinite consciously decided to become the finite. Knowledge tells us that within the Infinite, we can find the finite; and within the finite, we can find the Infinite. Just because God is infinite, He can enjoy Himself in the tiniest atom as well as in the infinite Vast.</p>
<p>Knowledge tells us something more. Divine knowledge tells us that the many and the One were, from the very beginning, identical; they were made together. The One is the Vision; the many is the Reality. From God’s Vision-Power, immediately Reality came into existence. Again, with Reality-Power, Vision came into existence. God wanted to enjoy Himself. He wanted to offer Nectar, Immortality, to His whole creation. With the creation He felt the expansion of His Self-Form, His manifested Form. When He first created the world, with His inner Vision He saw the ultimate future. Now, slowly, steadily and unerringly, He is unfolding His Vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>That ancient day<br />
When God created man,<br />
He wanted His blossoming Infinity<br />
To be loved<br />
By His embracing Immortality.</em>
</blockquote>
