<p>God loves us. He loves us constantly and unconditionally. No matter what we have done, what we are doing or what we shall do, He will always love us. God loves us much more than He loves Himself. If we use our thinking and doubting minds, this may seem hard to believe. But if we use our loving and surrendering hearts, then we are bound to feel that God loves us infinitely more than He loves Himself. Why does He love us so much? He loves us because He feels that His Dream remains unfulfilled without us, His Reality remains unmanifested without us; without us, He is incomplete.</p>
<p>There have been many, many times in our lives when we have felt miserable because we told a lie or deceived someone or became jealous of others. After we do something wrong, our conscience comes to the fore and we feel miserable. We curse ourselves and try to punish ourselves. But God’s Love for us remains exactly the same. We hate ourselves for our mistakes, but God still loves us and will always continue to love us. Our justice-power condemns us, but God’s Compassion-Power forgives us, illumines us and transforms our weakness into strength. God gets satisfaction when, with His blessingful Smile, He gives us His Compassion-Flood, His Concern-Sky and His Love-Sea so that we can grow into His very image.</p>
<p>God loves us, and in return He wants us to smile, to love and to transcend. The moment we offer Him a soulful smile, God is pleased with us. The moment we offer Him an iota of our love, God is pleased with us. The moment we want to transcend our earth-bound consciousness, God is pleased with us.</p>
<p>Our human love constantly tries to separate and divide, but the divine Love we get from God always adds and multiplies. God used His Delight-Power when He created the world, and now He uses His Love-Power to protect the world and bring perfection to earth, His creation.</p>
<p>God gives us what He has and what He is. What He has is infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, and what He is is His constant Concern - Concern for our liberation from the meshes of ignorance and Concern for our perfection. God loves us. We love God. By loving God, we gain victory over our age-old ignorance. By loving us, God makes us consciously feel that we are eternal players, divine players in His Cosmic Game.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>God definitely loves me<br />
No matter what I am doing,<br />
But He will definitely love me<br />
Infinitely more<br />
If He sees me dreaming<br />
Of becoming another God<br />
Like Him.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Love is the inner bond, the inner connection, the inner link between man and God, between the finite and the Infinite. We always have to approach God through love. Without love, we cannot become one with God. If we go through our journey with absolute love, we can never fail to reach God or fulfil Him, either in our own lives or in humanity.</p>
<p>What is love? If love means possessing someone or something, then that is not real love; that is not true love. If love means giving and becoming one with everything, with humanity and divinity, then that is real love. Real love is our total oneness with the object loved and with the possessor of love. Who is the possessor of love? God.</p>
<p>Whom are we loving? We are loving the Supreme in each individual. When we love the body, we bind ourselves; when we love the soul, we free ourselves. It is the soul in the individual, the Supreme in each human being, that we have to love.</p>
<p>Nothing can be greater than love. God is great only because He has infinite Love. If we want to define God, we can define Him in millions of ways, but I wish to say that no definition of God can be as adequate as the definition of God as all Love. When we say ‘God’, if fear comes into our mind, then we are millions and billions of miles away from Him. When we repeat the name of God, if love comes to the fore, then our prayer, our concentration, our meditation, our contemplation are genuine. There can be no greater wisdom, no greater knowledge, than love.</p>
<p>The world exists just because love still exists on earth. If this one divine quality left the world, then there could be no existence on earth. No other divine quality can create, sustain and fulfil God here on earth like the quality of love. Divine love does not mean an emotional exchange of human thoughts or ideas; it means the fulfilment of oneness.</p>
<p>
<em>How do I know that God loves me?</em>
</p>
<p>The Supreme has given you as a human being the capacity and potentiality to realise Him. If He is not kind, why has He given you this human life? He has given you this life, He has given you the aspiration, He has given you the opportunity and He has given you the capacity to realise His highest Height. Would He have given you all this if He did not love you? The Supreme does love you. That is why He has given you the aspiration to seek His Love.</p>
<p>If you think the Supreme does not love you, you have to know that you are a real fool. It is the Supreme who has created love. He has created your very existence. It is like a gardener who has created a garden with many beautiful flowers. If a flower says, “No, no, he does not love me!” is that not ridiculous? The very fact that the gardener has planted and cultivated the flowers—is this not his love? At every moment you have to feel that the Supreme does love you. Otherwise, He would not have brought you into His creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>God loves you<br />
For your heart’s<br />
Aspiration-purity.<br />
God loves you<br />
For your life’s<br />
Dedication-intensity.<br />
God loves you<br />
For your soul’s<br />
Omnipresent luminosity.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>What is the difference between human love and divine love?</em>
</p>
<p>Human love is very limited. In human love, there is every possibility of being captured by pleasure. In human love, there is practically no opportunity to expand our divine consciousness. True human love, even if it is not spiritual, will have some psychic emotion in it. This emotion will try to show us that love should not bind or impose. However, in human love we always feel that the other person does not want us or need us. There is always some fear or hatred in human love. Human love, as everybody knows, ends in frustration, and frustration is followed by destruction. In human love, we end up losing our own sweet feeling of oneness with the other person and we end up losing our divine reality.</p>
<p>Divine love makes no demand. It is spontaneous and constant. It is unlimited in every way. It is like the sun. The sun is for everybody. Everybody can use the sunlight, but if we keep our doors and windows shut, what can the sun do? It is God’s divine Love that has to act in and through human love. But if we do not care for the divine love that is flowing around us or wants to flow in us, then the divine love cannot function in and through us.</p>
<p>Human love binds; but before it binds it is already bound. Divine love illumines, but before it illumines, we see that it is already illumined. Divine love starts with the awareness of a higher reality. It is our constant conviction of a very high truth. Divine love at every moment illumines us, and in illumination we see total fulfilment.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>God unconditionally loves<br />
Each and every human being.<br />
Indeed, this is a divine mystery<br />
That no human mind can ever fathom.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>The very nature of human love is to stick only to one person and to reject everyone else. But in divine love, which is unlimited and infinite, the question of acceptance and rejection does not arise at all. In divine love there is no possession, but only a feeling of oneness. This oneness can enter into an animal, into a flower, into a tree or even into a wall. It is not like human love where today we want to possess one person or thing, tomorrow two persons, the day after tomorrow, three. When we have divine love for someone, at that time there is automatically inseparable oneness. No bridge is required; we just become one.</p>
<p>Divine love tells us that our life is infinitely more important than we imagine. Divine love means constant transcendence, not only of our human boundaries, but of God’s own Realisation in and through us.</p>
<p>In divine love, we grow. Divine love, the love of the soul, liberates and expands our consciousness. Love means oneness of divinity, oneness of reality, oneness of the individual consciousness with the unlimited Consciousness. When we enter into the Universal Consciousness through our meditation, we do not think of human love. We think only of divine love and oneness. If we have something small like a tiny knife, then we cannot cut something very big with it. But if we have a very big knife, then we can cut something large with it. The instrument that we are using right now is our very limited consciousness. That is why we are limited in our love. But if we use the other instrument, which is very vast, if we use the Universal Consciousness, our capacity for divine love becomes unlimited.</p>
<p>Divine love will come from God and from our own meditation, but only when we do not cherish expectation. A child expects either a penny or a nickel or a quarter from his father. More than that is beyond his expectation. If he expects from his father all the time, the father will give, but he will give only what the child expects. But if the child feels that whatever his father has is also his, and if he wants only to please his father, then when the father feels that the child is capable of receiving it, he will give the child all his wealth.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>I am just learning to feel<br />
That I do not have to actually catch God,<br />
But that someday God will catch me<br />
And pour into my heart<br />
A flood of ineffable Delight.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>When we do not expect anything from God, God will give us everything. He will say, “It is I who am giving the infinite Love. How is it that My children remain with very limited capacity, very limited achievement?” In order to prove that He and His children are one, that we are His worthy instruments, He will give us His infinite Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>When one becomes unconditionally surrendered to God’s Will, one gets infinite divine love. Everything will come in the form of love. We will get peace, but it will come in the form of love; and this peace we will offer to mankind through love. Just because we love, we are spreading our peace or power. God Himself manifests everything through Love. Here on earth and there in Heaven, there is only one thing that God is proud of, and that is Love, divine Love.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>We pray to God the Power<br />
But God the Lover<br />
Answers our prayers.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>How can we feel that God loves us infinitely more than we love ourselves?</em>
</p>
<p>The proof of the pudding is in the eating itself. The human in us feels that we are either the lowest or the highest. When it identifies with the lowest, it says, “I am useless, I am nothing.” In this way the vital comes forward and tries to gain sympathy. Each time a doubt comes and we feel that we are not God’s instrument, we fall short of our capacity. How many times we doubt ourselves, belittle ourselves, kill ourselves! The moment we doubt that God is inside us, a dark spot appears on the golden tablet of our heart. When we do not love ourselves, the face of the sun is covered with clouds. The moment we belittle our capacity and doubt ourselves, the moment we forget what we eternally are, at that time we are millions of miles from the truth. We love ourselves only when we feel that we have achieved something or feel that tomorrow or the day after we are going to do something. This is the human in us.</p>
<p>God is our highest part, our most illumined part. When we enter into our highest consciousness and know that we are in all, of all and for all, at that time we do not doubt ourselves. At that time, we are everything, so who can doubt whom? We embody God and want to reveal and manifest God, so we do not even dream of minimising our capacity. Here we are spontaneously embodying and revealing the divine.</p>
<p>When the real, the highest, the most illumined part in us comes to the fore, at that time we really love ourselves. We love ourselves because we know who we are. Love is not a kind of outer movement or action. Love is life, and life itself is spontaneous nectar and delight. So the Supreme in us, who is infinite Delight, loves us infinitely more than we love ourselves.</p>
<p>
<em>It appears to me that God’s Love is conditional, that it depends on whether I meditate and aspire properly or not, or whether I am appreciating it.</em>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, here you are making a mistake. Divine Love is not conditional; it does not depend on what you do. The reason you feel this way is because you do not empty your vessel. When you empty your inner vessel, you will see that love is flowing through you, and then you will feel that your vessel is full to the brim. God’s Love does not depend on what you do except in this sense: if you keep the door wide open, then the Highest can enter. But if you do not open your inner door, it is impossible for the highest Reality to enter into you.</p>
<p>Everything that comes from God is unconditional. His Love He gives unconditionally, but somebody has to receive it. The sunlight is unconditional; everybody can receive it. But if you remain fast asleep, if you do not want to open up the windows and doors, then for you there is no sunlight.</p>
<p>
<em>I don’t understand why God’s Love doesn’t enter into me even though I keep the doors shut.</em>
</p>
<p>If God’s Love enters into you when you are not receptive to it, then you will regard it as a foreign element. You will not appreciate it or care for it. If somebody brings most delicious food right in front of you but you do not appreciate it, then you will just discard it and feel that it has no value.</p>
<p>
<em>I may not know<br />
What is in God’s Mind,<br />
But I do know<br />
What is in God’s Heart:<br />
Unconditional Love for me.</em>
</p>
<hr /><p>
<em>Mine is the mind<br />
That is bewildered.<br />
Mine is the heart<br />
That is broken.<br />
Mine is the vital<br />
That is bruised.<br />
Mine is the soul<br />
That is aching.<br />
My Lord,<br />
Yet I feel<br />
That You love me,<br />
Yet I know<br />
That You care for me.</em>
</p>
<hr /><p>
<em>The love that spans the universe<br />
Is not new.<br />
It is old,<br />
Ancient<br />
And eternal.</em>
